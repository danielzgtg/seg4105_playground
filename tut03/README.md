## Summary

Pitch-writing is part of Shape Up, usually for new features' not products' directions. Balance the abstract and concrete. Frame before formalizing pitches. Let customers report problems only and have team find solutions after pitching. Reality and employees like creativity. Rabbit holes consume work, and spikes identify them. This prepares going to the Betting Table next.

Pitches write 800 words saying why and quoting customers but not how. Generally sketch without evidencing or bullet-pointing (i.e. no "spec" estimates which can't survive reality, but no ill-defined one-liners either) so that developers know the what and can understand and find a how fitting in 6 weeks' appetite. Ill-defineds don't have middles, shapes, boundaries, tradeoffs, cutoffs, essences, or meanings of done. Estimates fail after 2 weeks like Waterfall and can't adapt, but budgets work.

Any employee can pitch. It's just an idea. Combine ideas to formalize into shaping document which plans work. Especially support, but each team has 2-3 people. Optionally framing comes before formalized pitching, and just preserves and shares ideas.

Customer ideas must cohere before implementation. 5000 customers' solutions only work for themselves, and too many worsens software. Must find pattern from 10+ complaints and solve together. Abstract expressed solutions into core problems to consider constraints and possibilities. Pitch is never a solution but a direction.

Also employees find autonomy, mastery, and purpose fun. Teams should seek autonomouses understanding problems. People like building their own way not being instructed with exact outputs. Consider multiple and switch dimensions as necessary. Materials will reveal shortcuts for punctuality. Mastery is from problem solving and purpose from both designing and building.

In rabbit holes, work goes nowhere. Traps exist like automating the wrong things, instead of simplifying. Spot early as "no go" and don't get stuck. Drop things before they consume others tasks' time. A science project is a rabbit hole upscaled to an entire pitch. Software can show anything given time so failure mode is timed scope.

These label high risks, but are valuable information. 2-day spikes (a.k.a. tracer bullets) build scaffold (a.k.a traceables) to ascertain before actual. Know probabilities, concerns, hazards, and rabbit holes. Time whether 2 weeks, 4, or even within sprint. All this makes Betting Tables informed.

## Chapter 2

Shaping up is neither too concrete nor too abstract. It's between wireframes wrongly estimating and words lacking specification. Shaped work appears rough, but is thoughtfully solved and time-bounded. Both business and technical people are involved. It's not scheduled so that there is scheduling at building time.

## Chapter 3

Most ideas need to be marked out-of-bounds. Ideas must be worth the time investment before accepting. Team sets a time, and limit the scope accordingly. "Good" is relative to time. Team must analyze root cause of ideas but not show commitment. Team must clarify goals.

## Chapter 4

Quickly cover the solution space. Design semantics before visuals. Consider digraphs not materials. Question and revise. Fat-marker-sketch to be rough. Do not necessitate removing detail, as this is not deliverable.

## Chapter 5

Gracefully handle unanticipateds. Risk risks long tails. Ideally use small patch to problem. Declare out of bounds ahead of time, or cut back later. Ask experts with time bound.

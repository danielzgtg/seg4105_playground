## Chapter 7 Summary

Backlogs accumulate outdateds and waste time organizing.
A betting table simply looks at new and revived pitches for next cycle.

Everyone tracks their own list of ideas.
Each department prioritizes well their own types and talks to each other to improve.
Important ideas reoccur and rise unlike overvalueds.
Now the discussion is always relevant.

## Chapter 8 Summary

Need cycle to align schedules.
2 weeks has too much planning overhead.
Too long cycles can't highlight deadlines.
6 weeks is perfect.
2 weeks cool-down after for planning and freedom without crunch.

Teams are 1 designer, 2 programmers, and a QA person for later.
1-project teams are doing "big batch"es.
Others are doing "small batch"es of 1-2 week projects.

C-suite, business priorities, and progress are at betting table.
Executives feel control here, and commit to scheduling decisions.
A bet has a finished feature payout, 6 weeks' time commitment, and restricted to losing 6 weeks.
Committed time should not have its momentum interrupted.
Unfinished bets will be restricted to respect the appetite and let developers compromise.
These can be reshaped instead to avoid rabbit holes.

Bugs are as unimportant as most bets, and should be decided on.
Cool-down, the betting table, or the holiday bug smash can be used.

Urgent things will be handled at the next cycle, so don't bet before that and become inflexible.
Old work doesn't carry over, and 2-cycle features must deliver something for the 1st cycle.

## Chapter 9 Summary

Expectations differ across existing and new products.
Existings fit into unchanged code.
New ones have R&D, production, and cleanup phases.

R&D involves "spike"s.
Features or even product concept can be thrown away.
The goal is understanding after minimal shaping, not shipping.
Done by leaders to architect future, as they can't delegate without understanding.

Production is like existing products except shipping means committing code not meant to change.
There is a framework for everyone to contribute consciously.
Customers don't see so potentially undesired features can be removed later.

Cleanup lasts up to 2 cycles to avoid anxiety.
Everyone jumps in to commit small patches.
Leadership doesn't shape but points out importants before shipping.

Bet-evaluate asking questions.
Does the problem have enough business value?
Can a long solution be simplified until worth it?
Why do we want to spend time on this?
Why do are we fine with 2 but not 6 weeks?
Is the solution worth the resource/maintainability costs?
Discuss high-level not designing.
Do we want to do a different area of feature now?
Do we have a person with expertise?
When are they on vacation?
Finally, put the chosen bets decision in writing.

## Outline all tools

We decided on Fri 2023-10-13 in person to talk about scheduling the meeting on Sat 2023-10-14 over Discord. We negotiated the meeting time over Discord. We each copied the time into our own Google Calendars to remind ourselves of the time.

Individual commentaries on the pitches will be directly pushed to GitHub as Markdown in the respective folders.

The note taking for the betting table and the kickoff will use a newly created Word document in our capstone project team's shared OneDrive. Everyone can write and comment. These will be cleaned and pushed to GitHub later. The changes to the pitch will arise in both comments and minutes, and eventually make their way to GitHub, where they will be permanently tracked in the Git history.

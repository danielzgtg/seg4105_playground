## Scrum Guide

Even the original scrum guide was less than 1 page.

Daily scrum is 15 minutes forecasting and reviewing a day's work and progress. Improve collaboration at the same spacetime.

Ask:
- What did I progress yesterday?
- What will I progress today?
- What impedes me?

Scrum master supervises format not content of meeting. Detailed discussion meets adapting and replanning after the daily. Daily scrums are for subsuming other meetings, to decide and communicate quickly.

## Show Progress

Manages want to see not question progress.

Not all tasks are visible at start. Defining the first task in a scope can be deferred. The end of the scope can do a QA to create new issue fixing tasks. Tasks are imagined at the start but work discovers more tasks, so measuring halfway misleads. A 4-hour task done 10 times in the past is likely, but one having interdependencies might take 3 days upon impediments.

Hill chart goes up then down. Figure out what to do then get it done. Leftmost is not started. 25% is deciding some things. Topmost is knowing what to do. Then 75% is downhill doing the work. Rightmost is done and cleanup.

Scopes are each individual dots on the hill. Team drags their tasks themselves, then a task not moving for a while is questioned. Identify opportunities and risks early by reworking concepts, without people raising hands.

Some scopes mistakenly involved multiple things. Splitting a stuck scope apart allows each to progress. independently. Thinking without validating causes backsliding.

Solutions are to be sequenced by going uphill removing uncertainties first. Upon solving the crux, downhill work goes to completion. Solve most unknowns then fix nice-to-haves later.

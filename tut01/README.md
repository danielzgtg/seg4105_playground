### Later Brainstorming Notes

- Agile is incrementally evolving the product
- Waterfall is supposed to be step by step, but most of the time it's not as expected and the water fails to reach the goal
- Critical path only focus on the steps that (eventually after recursion) hold the final deadline back, and increases effort on them
- Hybrid just mixes the best of a bunch of different approaches
- Lean cleans away the unnecessary steps and their costs
